(FOUR) StockFI, AMADF, AMADYBy: Rob Williams, SA News Editor2 Comments    Zhanna Hapanovich/iStock via Getty Images Shift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) Chief Executive Officer Jared Isaacman said in a memo to employees that buyout offers didn’t adequately value the payments company, Bloomberg News reported Sunday. Shares of Shift4 (FOUR) are up about 14% to $77.50 in the past 12 months. After receiving multiple offers above the current share price, Shift4’s (FOUR) board determined they were too low, according to the memo cited by Bloomberg News. Isaacman last year had said in a letter to shareholders that the company was “actively exploring strategic opportunities and alternatives that will reduce distractions and serve our company, employees and shareholders best.” Shift4’s (FOUR) shares on February 28 jumped after Reuters reported that competitors Fiserv (FI) and Amadeus IT Group (OTCPK:AMADF) (OTCPK:AMADY) were interested in buying the company. A day later, Amadeus (OTCPK:AMADF) (OTCPK:AMADY) said it wasn’t interested. The shares fell about 10% since then. On Thursday, Fiserv (FI) Chief Financial Officer Robert Hau said at an investor conference that most of its acquisitions are "of moderate size."  More on Shift4 Payments  Shift4 Payments, Inc.
