Still, investors are eagerly anticipating important announcements from FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and a set of prominent consumer brands, such as Nike (NYSE:NKE), Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), which could provide insights into consumer sentiment and spending trends.

Tuesday, March 19 XPeng (XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) is set to report its Q4 financial data on Tuesday, before the bell. The Chinese EV manufacturer's stock has declined approximately 36% so far this year, partly due to the impact of the timing of the Chinese New Year on the company's monthly delivery numbers. Despite this, Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system upgraded the stock to Hold from a prior Sell rating in the last week of February, while Wall Street analysts maintain a Buy rating.

Wednesday, March 20 Micron Technology (MU) Micron Technology (MU) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings after Wednesday's closing bell. Recently, Stifel upgraded the memory chipmaker to Buy from Hold, with analyst Brian Chin raising the price target to $120 from $80. Chin believes tightening conditions in the dynamic random access memory supply will allow Micron to optimize its product mix, including DDR5/LPDDR5, high-capacity DIMMs, and HBM, and augment cyclical recovery in gross margins. Micron is also seen as going through a "sweet spot" for memory, according to Stifel, which should drive multiple expansions due to its increased connection to artificial intelligence via high-bandwidth memory. Meanwhile, the stock continues to receive a Hold rating from Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system, as opposed to a Buy recommendation from Wall Street analysts. "Micron Technology is poised to capitalize on AI adoption and the growing AI server retooling market through its partnership with Nvidia to sell HBM3e memory for AI GPUs, with a focus on innovation in AI DRAM utilization," writes SA author Noah's Arc Capital Management.

Thursday, March 21 FedEx (FDX) FedEx (FDX), headquartered in Memphis and a major player in package delivery services, is set to announce its quarterly earnings after Tuesday's closing bell. Despite a strong performance, with a gain of over 29% over a period of 12 months, the company receives a Hold rating from SA's Quant Ratings, contrasting with the consensus Buy rating maintained by Wall Street analysts. SA investing group leader Leo Nelissen points out that while FedEx faces intense competition from Amazon, its analyst expectations and cost-saving strategies suggest potential growth. However, Nelissen advises caution for investors due to FedEx's diversification efforts and technological advancements in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape. In contrast, Stock Waves, another SA investing group leader, takes a more bearish stance, noting that FedEx's price structure indicates a potential downside pattern in the future. However, Stock Waves cautions that this assumption could be flawed, considering the methodology used to track and project stocks like FedEx.  Consensus EPS Estimates: $3.51 Consensus Revenue Estimates: $22.09B Earnings Insight: FedEx has beaten EPS estimates in 4 of the past 8 quarters, rising above revenue expectations in only one of those reports.  Nike (NKE)  Nike (NKE) is scheduled to report its quarterly results on Thursday after the closing bell. Following a mixed performance in its prior quarter, Nike CFO Matthew Friend characterized the company's financial results as a turning point toward driving more profitable growth. Looking ahead to a softer second-half revenue outlook, Nike remains committed to strong gross margin execution and disciplined cost management. The stock has a Hold rating from Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system, reflecting a more cautious stance compared to the consensus Buy rating from Wall Street analysts. SA author Wiebe De Ruyck notes that NKE's valuation remains at a premium, potentially exposing it to downside risk if market confidence in its growth prospects wanes.   Consensus EPS Estimates: $0.76 Consensus Revenue Estimates: $12.29B Earnings Insight: The company has beaten EPS estimates 7 times in the past 8 quarters and revenue expectations in 6 of those reports.
